Sublime-Text-Things
===================

This repo has things for my personal Sublime Text from prefs to quick keys I use often and would like to remember.

## Quick Keys

    <tr>
        <td>CMD + P + fuzzy seach CSS file + @element</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>CMD + R</td>
        <td>Allows you to jump to methods based on their name. Can also use CMD + P and start search with @. This can also be used with CSS.</td>
